TO MR. GUSTIN:
Sorry we didn't do the commits on this repository, we had already started our own and didn't realize this one was here. We can share with you the repo we used if you want to see our commit history, however all of the commits are labeled as from Jackson Roberts because we used Atom Teletype to do realtime simultaneous file editing.
